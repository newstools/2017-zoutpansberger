Date: 30 January 2017 By: Isabel VenterViewed: 1643Even though water delivery was restored to Louis Trichardt, residents were cautioned on Monday to clean the water themselves.Water currently pumped in the Louis Trichardt system is filtered, but untreated. This means it is NOT SAFE for human consumption. This is according to DA ward councillor Mr Brian de Plooy. &ldquo;At this stage the water is going through filters, but that is about it,&rdquo; said Du Plooy telephonically. He added that the faulty pumps at the treatment plant were repaired, but that the system cannot handle the backlog, hence the water is not properly treated.The VDM (Vhembe District Municipality) was also contacted to verify this information. Their spokesperson asked for time to verify the current state of affairs at the water treatment plant. He promised feedback during the day.Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter. She holds a BA Degree in Communication Sciences from the University of South Africa.
