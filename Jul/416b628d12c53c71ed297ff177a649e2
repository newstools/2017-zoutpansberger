Date: 06 July 2017 By: Isabel VenterViewed: 124Construction work on the N1 north to Musina started on Monday.According to SANRAL (South African National Roads Agency Limited) work on the road is expected to be finished by December 2017.The construction is necessary to improve both the quality and safety of the road. Hence the implementation of lane closures will be necessary. This will also mean that travel time between Musina and Louis Trichardt will be delayed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Road users are urged to be patient when travelling through the construction sites and comply with the instructions of the safety flag persons at all times,&rdquo; urged SANRAL. Construction workers and vehicles, as well as construction machinery, will be moving in and out of these construction areas.If there are any enquiries or complaints these can be directed to the engineering consultant&rsquo;s representative, Kennedy Kasapo. He can be contacted at Tel 078 198 3441 or via email at kennedy.kasapo@deltabec.com.&nbsp;Alternatively, the site agent, Andile Mkhongo, can be contacted at Tel 082 772 6070 or by email at andile@hillary.co.za.SANRAL appealed to motorists to reduce speeds as indicated to ensure the safety of other road users and the people working on the road. It apologises for any inconvenience caused during construction and the inevitable time delays, but believes that on completion, the road will be safer and ensure a better and uninterrupted journey to the road user.Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter.
