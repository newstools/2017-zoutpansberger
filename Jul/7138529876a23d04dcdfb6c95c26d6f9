Date: 09 July 2017 By: Viewed: 67The Mapungubwe: Echoes in the Valley trilogy is on air on SABC 3 on Sunday (9 July).It will start at 21:30. This series marks the latest offering from acclaimed historical documentarian and producer Nhlanhla Mthethwa.Ms Cookie Mona, commissioning editor at SABC Education said that &ldquo;the documentary series raises the bar in historical visual documentation and will certainly keep viewers engaged as they journey into a proud but seldom told history of African civilization.&rdquo;&nbsp;Mapungubwe was one of Southern Africa&rsquo;s well-known pre-colonial states. The formation of this ancient civilisation culminated in the establishment of a prominent sovereign state with its own political organisation and structures. The inhabitants of Mapungubwe were found to be master goldsmiths, stonemasons, potters and established a vibrant trading commercial network with China, India and Egypt.In this three-part series, the official history is disrupted through the telling of Mapungubwe&rsquo;s history through the eyes of the indigenous peoples of Southern Africa.In this narrative, award winning director, Mandla Dube interviews Southern African orators, archaeologists, academics, writers and historians that debunk the misconception that colonialism brought civilisation to pre-colonial Southern Africa.&nbsp;Dube&rsquo;s expeditions across the sub-Sahara demonstrate the extent to which Africa is replete with ancient dynasties and civilisations that precede Euro-American hegemony.Mandla Dube&rsquo;s exploration of the history of Mapungubwe comes at an opportune time as South Africa is currently engaged in decolonial discourses that seek to reimagine the African image. In this context, this series contributes to indigenous knowledge building. (SABC education).Email: More photos...
