Mr Aleas Matshisevhe says fire is being made in the wrong places where it can lead to massive damage to thatched chalets and the wildlife.Date: 17 July 2017 By: Tshifhiwa MukwevhoViewed: 207The Matshisevhe Communal Property Association outside Tshikwarani village is facing a &ldquo;serious crisis&rdquo;, with some beneficiaries accusing the present CPA management of maladministration and the squandering of resources.This came to light after two beneficiaries, Mr Aleas Matshisevhe and Mr Sam Mudau, visited Limpopo Mirror&lsquo;s offices recently with the allegations about the CPA.According to the two beneficiaries, the current committee&rsquo;s term had elapsed on 12 March 2015 and they now continued to run the CPA illegaly. &ldquo;Their term has expired and they use the same tactic of not holding general meetings &hellip; (they) continue running the CPA without being elected,&rdquo; said Mr Sam Mudau.The land was claimed in 1998 and granted in 2008. The granted farms include Uniondale Farm, Carlsdorp Farm and Bristol Farm.The first committee was elected in 2009 and ran the CPA for three years. Matshisevhe and Mudau said that during the first committee&rsquo;s reign, all things were running well, and the CPA&rsquo;s operational reports were brought to the people during general meetings.&ldquo;There was a person who was designated to look after the place, which was an old residential house of the previous owner,&rdquo; Mudau said. &ldquo;However, the 2012 committee removed the caretaker without any tangible reason being given to the beneficiaries.&rdquo;The second committee&rsquo;s term was supposed to end on 12 March 2015. &ldquo;The CPA is now operating without a legitimate committee, but with some brazen, self-imposed committee who gives us no annual financial reports,&rdquo; Matshisevhe said.Mudau added that the &ldquo;same individuals who were elected in 2012 influenced some close relatives, so that they remain in authority without any elections in 2015. The committee comprise eight pensioners, who are all over 65 years of age.&rdquo;Matshisevhe and Mudau claim that there is exploitation of resources and minerals. &ldquo;Sand miners pay R3 000 per truck per month, wood gets charged at R250 and R450 per load to an individual, who is only a beneficiary,&rdquo; Matshisevhe said. He said that there were more than 15 trucks that mined and collected sand on a daily basis. The committee allegedly charges R35 per head for cattle grazing on the land.The &ldquo;self-imposed committee&rdquo; removed all beneficiaries who were guards at the main gates and replaced them by non-beneficiaries without consulting the Matshisevhe community, the men claim. &ldquo;We believe that they wanted to exploit the resources and minerals without beneficiaries being witness to it at the gates and inside the land,&rdquo; they say.When contacted for comment on Monday, &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; Mr Alfred Mushapho quickly visited Limpopo Mirror and said that he would call a management meeting before they could issue a statement. However, he called the journalist later that day and said: &ldquo;We have agreed among ourselves that you (journalist) should just write what you want to write about us.&rdquo;Tshifhiwa Given Mukwevho was born in 1984 in Madombidzha village, not far from Louis Trichardt in the Limpopo Province.
