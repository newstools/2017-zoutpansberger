In the letter, residents are urged to start using the new municipal dumping site behind Tshikota. At that stage, Bobodi said that the exiting dumping site will close as it has already reached maximum capacity.Andries joined the Zoutpansberger&nbsp;and Limpopo Mirror in April 1993 as a darkroom assistant.
