At the time of the report, officials could not give an exact estimation of how long the problem will take to repair.A ward councillor for the local Democratic Alliance (DA) Mr Brian du Plooy said that it was a pipe that burst near pump station one. He lashed out against the VDM that did not forewarn the public in time. &ldquo;We only received this information this morning &hellip; there is no communication from the municipality, as usually,&rdquo; said Du Plooy.In the meantime, residents are urged to use water sparingly and, if needed, to fetch water from AfriForum&rsquo;s borehole on the corner of De La Rey and Rivier Street.Updates will be made available as the situation at the treatment plant progresses.Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter.
