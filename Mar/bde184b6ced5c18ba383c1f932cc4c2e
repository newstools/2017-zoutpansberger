Date: 03 March 2017 By: Isabel VenterViewed: 273The Ridgeway school community in Louis Trichardt came out in droves to support the school&rsquo;s first ever Rainbow Run over this past weekend.Judging by the riot of colour along both the 2.5km and 5km route - from yellow to orange, green, blue and pink - it was a fun-filled, colourful day enjoyed immensely by all. The Rainbow Run was not only fun for all, it also kicked off the school&rsquo;s 20th birthday celebrations and even made history by being Louis Trichardt&rsquo;s first ever walk of its kind. Young and old took to the course, which began and ended at Ridgeway College.The sea of white T-shirts soon turned to a kaleidoscope of colour as the walkers were bombarded with colour along the route. &ldquo;The Rainbow Run served to bring the community together, through laughter, camaraderie and the true spirit of our Rainbow Nation,&rdquo; said the school.As always, it would not have been possible to organise the event without the support of the community, parents and generous businesses. Therefore, the school gave a heartfelt thank you to the following sponsors: Coca-Cola Fortune, Mr Mutwanamba, Mr and Mrs Patel, C Jay&rsquo;s Salon, KFC, Wimpy, Cater Pack, Timber City, Soutpansberg Spar, Midas Spares, Premjee &amp; Sons, Surat, Dr Ayob, Seisoene and Mrs Kamera.&nbsp;Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter.
