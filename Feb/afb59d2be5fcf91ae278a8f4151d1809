The research report was published by the University of Cardiff&rsquo;s School of Biosciences. They discovered that 44 of 64 genetic lineages is no longer existing. &ldquo;The future is bleak for the black rhino unless the conservation of genetically distinct populations is made a priority,&rdquo; said the university.The research team used DNA extracted from a combination of tissue and faecal samples from wild animals, and skin from museum specimens. They sequenced DNA from maternal mitochondrial genome and used classical DNA profiling to measure genetic diversity in past and present populations and compared the profiles and sequences of animals in different regions of Africa.Professor Mike Bruford from the university said: &ldquo;Our findings reveal that hunting and habitat loss has reduced the evolutionary potential of the black rhinoceros dramatically over the last 200 years. The magnitude of this loss in genetic diversity really did surprise us - we did not expect it to be so profound.&rdquo;Bruford explained that the next step will be to sequence the black rhino genome to see how the loss of genetic diversity is likely to affect populations across all its genes. According to Bruford, this will provide vital information given the current poaching epidemic and the fact that some groups are being targeted more than others.The black rhino has already been hunted to extinction in many parts of Africa and now survives in only five countries which are South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Tanzania.The full report can be read on the Cardiff University&rsquo;s site at: &nbsp;&nbsp;Cardiff UniversityEmail: More photos...
