Musina Mayor&nbsp;Cllr Mihloti Muhlope.Date: 18 February 2017 By: News CorrespondentViewed: 568The mayor of the Musina Local Municipality, Cllr Mihloti Muhlope, has asked the municipal council to reallocate the R1,1million budget for the mayoral car to other service delivery initiatives.Muhlope said her decision was influenced by the current financial position of the municipality, which needs wise expenditure patterns. She said the world was facing tough economic challenges and Musina was not an exception.&ldquo;It is my intention to redirect the funding towards addressing pressing service delivery needs. We have other important backlogs which need to be addressed and these&nbsp;include the damaged roads, servicing (our)&nbsp;Eskom debt and other infrastructure development initiatives. Our people are waiting for much-needed basic services and it is important to prioritize when we spend the little budget that we have. The issue of the mayoral vehicle is not a priority for now and the municipality can run without the procurement thereof.&rdquo;She said the need to procure the mayoral vehicle was informed by, among others, the fact&nbsp;that the municipality doid&nbsp;not have a mayoral vehicle, since the previous vehicle had exceeded its lifespan and was not economically viable to repair or maintain.&ldquo;I further put it on record that the rental vehicle that was sourced to assist me in executing my official duties will no longer be used and I will make use of my personal vehicle to execute official duties,&rdquo; she added. She also said that she made the decision voluntarily, &ldquo;to set a positive example that we can steer the municipality to achieve its goal of delivering efficient services, despite limited resources&rdquo;. She emphasized that the municipality&rsquo;s priority remained&nbsp;that of providing essential services within the available means.Muhlope said she would continue to play her oversight role to make sure that Musina Municipality continued&nbsp;to deliver better and affordable services to all citizens.&nbsp;Correspondent journalists&nbsp;from all over the region supply us with news and sport articles.&nbsp;Email: news@zoutnet.co.zaMore photos...
