A road in Thohoyandou that was blocked with burning rubble and other objects.Date: 25 May 2017 By: Elmon TshikhudoViewed: 8261Thohoyandou came to a standstill this morning (Thursday) with angry protestors blockading streets with burning rubble and other objects.The protestors, who forced all shops to close, were protesting against the spate of ritual murders that had recently rocked the Vhembe area. Signs of the protests showed in the morning when shopkeepers in the Block F area of Thohoyandou did not open their businesses.A group from Block F gathered in town near a hardware store, where others joined them and it then became a full-blown strike.Protestors alleged&nbsp;that the many ritual murders were being funded by foreign nationals who promise large amounts of cash for body parts.The rumour was compounded by the recent kidnap drama of a 19-year-old Muhotoni schoolboy, who miraculously survived the knives of body part merchants, after being kidnapped on his way to morning classes in the area. Blindfolded and drugged, the boy was found at Tshikundamalema, many kilometres from his village.In this case, an Indian businessman from Thohoyandou was arrested last week and was released on bail of R3 000. This has made communities very angry and they have vowed to stop Indians from operating in town. Elmon Tshikhudo started off as a photographer.
