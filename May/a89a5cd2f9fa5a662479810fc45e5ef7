Date: 29 May 2017 By: Isabel VenterViewed: 1066The mining company, Coal of Africa (CoAL) announced on Monday morning that the Minister of Water and Sanitation, Nomvula Mokonyane, had&nbsp;lifted the suspension on the integrated water-use licence for their open-cast Makhado mining project.The licence was suspended, following an appeal that was made by the anti-mining group, Vhembe Mineral Resources Forum (VMRF). CoAL lodged a counter-appeal to have the suspension lifted. Following representation by CoAl in May 2016 and February 2017, minister Mokonyane exercised her discretion and lifted the suspension in terms of Section 148 of the National Water Act.This will mean that the water licence is now executable, and that any appellants will have the opportunity to voice their concerns through the government&rsquo;s water tribunal.CoAL&#39;s chief executive, David Brown, welcomed the lifting of the suspension of the licence by Mokonyane as it completes the suite of regulatory authorisations required for the Makhado Project. &quot;It further confirms government&rsquo;s support for the Makhado Project and its potential to drive sustainable socio-economic transformation,&quot; Brown said in a press statement on Monday.&quot;We will continue to work with all parties to ensure that the matter is completed satisfactorily and furthermore to secure the remaining surface rights,&rdquo; he further added.Keep an eye out for a detailed report in this week&#39;s editon of the&nbsp;Zoutpansberger.Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter.
