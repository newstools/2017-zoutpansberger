We therefore would like to advise visitors to take the necessary precautions which include the use of prophylaxes and vaccinations in consultation with their doctors to prevent the possibility of contracting malaria as the Kruger National Park is known to be one of the malaria endemic areas in this country,&rdquo; said Mr William Masaba, SANParks Acting Head of Communications, in a press release.The park said that the chances of contracting malaria can be minimized by using repellents on the skin, keeping the gauze door and windows close and also ensuring these are not broken, as well as spraying the inside of the hut or bungalow with insecticide. &ldquo;Although malaria can be contracted at any time of the year, the malaria season in this country is October to April, with March and April the highest risk period. However, this year it seems to be slightly different. With winter approaching, mosquitoes which are carriers of the parasite causing malaria, should begin to hibernate and the situation shall possibly improve,&rdquo; Mabasa said.Mabasa said that there are medical doctors permanently based in Skukuza, NKP&rsquo;s main camp and the public can also consult them for information and advice prior to their visit to the park on telephone number +27 13 735 5638.Andries joined the Zoutpansberger&nbsp;and Limpopo Mirror in April 1993 as a darkroom assistant.
