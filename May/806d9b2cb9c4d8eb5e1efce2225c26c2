Coal of Africa LimitedDate: 06 May 2017 By: Isabel VenterViewed: 189Mining company&nbsp;Coal of Africa Limited (CoAL)&nbsp;is serious about making the shift from being an exploration company to becoming a coal producer.CoAL has been struggling since 2013 to get back in the game after floods caused major damage&nbsp;to their Vele Colliery. This week the company outlined&nbsp;what they called &quot;a quarter of overdue good news&quot;, after they sold an asset, raised capital, reduced cash outflows and acquired a mine that will give them their first production in years.&nbsp;&quot;The company is making good progress towards re-entering the market as a coal producer, while focusing on the timeous funding and finalisation of the regulatory and surface right requirements for the Makhado project,&quot; said CoAL&rsquo;s CEO David Brown in the company report for the first quarter of 2017.Brown gave a long list of the positive developments at CoAL, in contrast to the company&#39;s struggle&nbsp;to bring its Vele coking coal mine in Limpopo into production and to start construction of their Makhado Colliery in the face of opposition.These positive developments include CoAL&#39;s&nbsp;recent agreement with Pan African Resources to buy their Uitkomst colliery in KwaZulu-Natal for R275 million. Brown hopes that CoAL will be able to pay, in part, for the new mine through income derived from&nbsp;production.Insofar as it concerns the Makhado Colliery, the Industrial Development Corporation has agreed to give CoAL a R240 million loan in exchange for a 15% holding in Baobab Mining and Exploration, a CoAL subsidiary company that owns the Makhado project.The company is developing the flagship Makhado project, which will produce hard coking and thermal coal through open-cast mining.&nbsp;Currently, the Makhado project is still delayed as the integrated water-use licence for&nbsp;the project had been suspended, following an appeal that was made by the anti-mining group, Vhembe Mineral Resources Forum (VMRF).&nbsp; The interim court interdict that was granted in 2014 has brought mining and further construction activity to a complete halt. Brown is, however, positive that the Department of Mineral Resources will come to a favourable decision once they have reviewed the matter and will lift the suspension &ldquo;soon.&rdquo;In addition, CoAL is also battling to secure the surface rights for Makhado, which is spread over five farms, all with registered land claims.&nbsp;The company has previously said that it intended to commence construction in calendar year 2018, subject to board approval.&nbsp;Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter.
