Date: 25 May 2017 By: Anton van ZylViewed: 57The Vikings team scored a surprise victory on Sunday when they beat Limpopo in the first semifinal of the Louis Trichardt Cricket Club League.Limpopo opted to bat first on what looked like a very good wicket. AJ Fourie started their innings off on a solid note by scoring 53 runs from 57 balls. His innings included four boundaries and two sixes. When Leon Olwage joined him, the scoring rate increased dramatically. Leon scored a brisk 76 from only 48 balls. He hit no fewer than seven sixes and helped take the score to 165/2 after 20 overs.Vikings&rsquo; bowlers had limited success, but Jandr&eacute; Hancke impressed with figures of 1/6 in four overs, which included one maiden over.Vikings&rsquo; batsmen attacked from the word go and, thanks to Craig Viljoen (48 from 28 balls) and Kobus Barkhuizen (45 from 29 balls), got off to a flying start. Warno Smit (31 from 25) helped to take the score to 167/3 in the 17th over. None of the Limpopo bowlers could boast with their figures, as these looked fairly dismal.The semifinal between Powerfix and Strikers, which was scheduled for Sunday morning, had to be postponed. This match is now scheduled for Sunday, 28 May. The final match between Vikings and the winner between Powerfix and Strikers&nbsp;is scheduled for Sunday, 4 June.Anton van Zyl has been with the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror for over 25&nbsp;years.
