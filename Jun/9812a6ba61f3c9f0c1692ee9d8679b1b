Mazwai also championed the renewed #DataMustFall campaign yesterday and called upon all South Africans to boycott all social media platforms from midnight.The protest is about lowering data prices and about data expiry, said Mazwai.&ldquo;The social media blackout is a campaign that is aimed at lowering data prices. Data costs are obscene and are not affordable for people on the ground. We want to bring attention to this issue; we want to engage government and cellular network companies,&rdquo; said Mazwai.The #DataMustFall campaign, which also uses the hashtag #SocialMediaBlackout, is asking people not to buy mobile data bundles for one day and to stay off platforms such as&nbsp;Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.Mazwai further encouraged people to take part in the campaign because it is too expensive to access information. &ldquo;We keep talking about #feesmustfall, but how must students access information or hand in assignments if data costs are so high? This has a negative impact on entrepreneurs and our families because we can&rsquo;t communicate with them,&rdquo; said Mazwai.Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter.
