So too is the Louis Trichardt SPCA grateful for Oasis Water for helping to keep their doors open and to care for all the animals that come through the SPCA&rsquo;s gates.To date, the company&rsquo;s owners Sean and Hestie Collett have sponsored the sterilizations of 65 dogs adopted from the Louis Trichardt SPCA. &ldquo;This means that the money we would have spent on the sterilizations could be applied elsewhere, such as buying food for the animals in our care or to treat the sick or wounded animals we received, as well as keeping our senior inspector, Lawrence Khodobo, and the rest of our dedicated staff in our service,&rdquo; said local SPCA chairperson Yolanda Cronj&eacute;.&nbsp;Oasis Water&rsquo;s sterilisation sponsorship campaign started in November 2016 and they have generously extended the offer to December 2017.&ldquo;It is a non-negotiable condition when an animal is adopted from the SPCA that the animal be sterilized.&nbsp; You may be wondering why we do not allow breeding? I could write a book filled with reasons, but I will only list our biggest motivators. It is the best and most efficient weapon against the indiscriminate reproduction and consequent overpopulation of domesticated animals.&nbsp; Spaying or neutering also reduces the animal&rsquo;s urge to roam around, while sterilisation&nbsp;reduces the risk of cancers in both male and female animals, thus extending its life expectancy,&rdquo; said Cronj&eacute;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cronj&eacute; said that many people did&nbsp;not know that the Louis Trichardt SPCA did&nbsp;not make any money from adoptions.&nbsp; &ldquo;We always say the we are not a pet store, but we are supplying loving families with companion animals. And this costs us money. The R650 adoption fee per dog goes towards the sterilization, inoculations, deworming and microchipping. You&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find such value for money anywhere else,&rdquo; said Cronj&eacute;. She added that having the pressure of the sterilization costs lifted from their shoulders was a massive relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;We do not get any government grants or assistance from our local municipality. Our funds are nearly 100% generated by the committee members, attending every possible function in town, selling merchandise and always thinking of new and innovative ways to earn more much-needed funds,&rdquo; said Cronj&eacute;.&nbsp;The Louis Trichardt SPCA is truly grateful for Oasis Water for giving them a lifeline. With their help, the SPCA can reach more animals in need and provide exceptional care to the ones who have already reached them. &ldquo;There is no way the Louis Trichardt SPCA could thank Sean and Hestie enough.&nbsp; Theirs is such an incredible, selfless gesture and we are forever grateful for the help already received and yet to come.&nbsp; Our cup&nbsp;runneth over, with Oasis Water, of course!&rdquo; said Cronj&eacute;.Andries joined the Zoutpansberger&nbsp;and Limpopo Mirror in April 1993 as a darkroom assistant.
