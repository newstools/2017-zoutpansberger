A young woman was injured after she was knocked off her scooter in front of Fruit &amp; Veg City in Grobler Street, Louis Trichardt, on Tuesday afternoon (27th). According to information available to the newspaper, a silver sedan allegedly turned into the parking lot, right in front of the woman who was on her way in the direction of the KFC Drive-Thru. The occupants of the sedan were unharmed, but the woman had to be taken to the hospital. Bystanders at the scene of the accident were somewhat upset with the Makhado Police for not attending to the accident promptly. Forty minutes after the crash, family and friends of the parties involved had to clear debris from the road themselves. The matter was brought to the attention of the police.
