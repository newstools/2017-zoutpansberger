Multiple award-winning darts player&nbsp;Portia Nompumelelo Nkundlande from Musina needs financial assistance to participate in the South African Darts Championships in Durban.Date: 23 June 2017 By: Wilson DzebuViewed: 187A gifted and multiple award-winning local darts player might not be able to represent Vhembe in Durban next month if she fails to raise the R10 000 needed for the flight, meals and accommodation.Portia Nompumelelo Nkundlande from Musina is appealing to good Samaritans to come to her rescue, so that she can take part in the week-long South African Darts Championships.As a member of the Vhembe Darts Association, Portia is the only black person in her team that is supposed to take part in the championships in Durban. Since the organization does not have enough money, it was agreed that individual players would pay for their expenses to participate in the games.The team walloped their opponents in various regional and provincial competitions to book their place in the championships in Durban.Portia says it will be a very big disappointment if she cannot realize her dream of participating in the championships in Durban. &ldquo;I always had a dream to turn professional and the tournament will be a stepping stone to realize this dream. There is this perception amongst our people that darts is a white man&#39;s sport, but I want to rewrite&nbsp;history and show everyone that even black people can excel at&nbsp;this sport. In my spare time, I engage young black kids and teach them how to play this exciting sport.&rdquo;She is appealing to businesspeople, individual community members and sports lovers to help her with the cash for her Durban trip. &ldquo;It will turn me off to see my fellow white team mates boarding a plane to Durban while I&rsquo;m left behind. I beg anyone to make some financial contributions so that I can be part of the team. Even small amounts are welcome, but bigger amounts will be appreciated from those who can afford it.&rdquo;To give her financial assistance, Portia can be phoned on 072 891 6698.Email: More photos...
