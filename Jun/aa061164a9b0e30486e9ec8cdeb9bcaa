They confirmed on Sunday that the burst had been fixed and that the normal flow of water was restored to town between 12:00 and 16:00.In the meantime, the VDM wants to get the court order obtained by AfriForum on 17 March&nbsp;set aside. The court had ordered the VDM to, inter alia, restore the town&rsquo;s water supply, re-establish the borehole project and protect all the boreholes from further vandalism. Furthermore, the VDM has&nbsp;to give notice timeously of when the community will be without water.According to the local AfriForum chairperson, Mr Wally Schultz, the municipality has not yet made any efforts to comply with the court order.&nbsp;In addition, the local branch finished compiling water samples to have tested as part of AfriForum&#39;s annual independent Blue Drop Report.Further details about the ongoing court battle&nbsp;between AfriForum and the VDM will be made available in this week&rsquo;s edition of the Zoutpansberger.Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter.
