Portia Nompumelelo Nkundlande.Date: 29 June 2017 By: Viewed: 551In last week&rsquo;s edition, we published a story Local darts player needs help.&nbsp;The story was about Musina-based darts player&nbsp;Portia Nompumelelo Nkundlande, who needed financial assistance to participate in the South African Darts Championships in Durban.After a discussion with the chairperson of the Vhembe Darts Association, Mr Jean Viljoen, we established that a misunderstanding occurred &nbsp;between Portia and the association. Viljoen has put it on record that Portia&nbsp;is not part of the team that is going to participate in Durban. As such, she does not have any basis for&nbsp;asking for financial assistance.&ldquo;We know this player very well, but she is not part of the team that should compete in Durban. Firstly, a player must have the Darts South Africa (DSA) number in order to participate in the championship and Portia does not have it. She does not have powers to raise funds for the event that she is not going to attend.&rdquo;Meanwhile, Portia admitted the misunderstanding between her and the Vhembe Darts Association. &ldquo;I was reliably informed that all the documentation of the participating players has&nbsp;already been processed by the tournament organizers and mine was not submitted because I was late. I have accepted that I&rsquo;m not going to take part in the championship, but I believe that my time will come one day.&rdquo;Email: More photos...
