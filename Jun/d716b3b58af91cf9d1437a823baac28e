Date: 17 June 2017 By: Andries van ZylViewed: 428Consumers in the Makhado municipal area can expect a 6,4% increase in property rates and other service tariffs, while electricity rates will go up by 1,88% as from 1 July this year.This is according to the Makhado Municipality&rsquo;s 2017/18 budget, tabled during Mayor Shonisani Sinyosi&rsquo;s state-of-the-municipality and budget speech on 2 June. During her speech, Sinyosi mainly focussed on issues of service delivery in regard of&nbsp;the municipality&rsquo;s capital budget, totalling R163&nbsp;758&nbsp;000, with little being said about the municipality&rsquo;s operational budget and how the municipality is going to pay for everything. The municipality supplied the Zoutpansberger&nbsp;with&nbsp;a copy of the operational budget this week.Budget in BriefThe municipality&rsquo;s operational budget totals R919&nbsp;450&nbsp;000 for the 2017/18 financial year, of which R841&nbsp;501&nbsp;000 will go towards operational expenditure, leaving the municipality with a R77&nbsp;949&nbsp;000 surplus.Expected Operational RevenueThe biggest contribution toward the operational budget revenue for the 2017/18 financial year will come from the sale of electricity, with a projected turnover of R317&nbsp;429&nbsp;000. The second-biggest contribution (R300&nbsp;109&nbsp;000) will come from operational transfers, while the income derived from property rates comes in&nbsp;third, totalling R55&nbsp;915 000. A further R55&nbsp;176&nbsp;000 will come from &ldquo;agency services&rdquo;, although the budget does not specify what these services are. Other revenue includes &ldquo;other revenue&rdquo; (R30&nbsp;587&nbsp;000), interest on outstanding debtors (R13&nbsp;726&nbsp;000), licenses and permits (R12&nbsp;567&nbsp;000), service charges &ndash; refuse removal (R10&nbsp;021&nbsp;000), interest earned on external investments (R5&nbsp;331&nbsp;000), fines, penalties and forfeits (R1&nbsp;889&nbsp;000) and rent (R502&nbsp;000). The above-mentioned excludes a further amount of R116&nbsp;196 000, which is reflected as revenue from capital transfer (national, provincial and district).Key items of Operational ExpenditureWith an overall increment of 7,36%&nbsp;as guided by the National Treasury, wages and salaries will again eat up the largest piece of the revenue cake, totalling R282&nbsp;794&nbsp;000. This excludes&nbsp;the R25&nbsp;958&nbsp;000 to go towards the remuneration of councillors. The second-biggest expense will be bulk purchases (mainly electricity) totalling R212&nbsp;748&nbsp;000, while &ldquo;other expenditure&rdquo; comes in at third place, totalling R190&nbsp;408&nbsp;000. During the 2017/18 financial year, the municipality also foresees writing off an amount of R95&nbsp;872&nbsp;000 due to depreciation and asset impairment, while R12&nbsp;720&nbsp;000 will go towards finance charges. An amount of R11 million will be spent&nbsp;on contracted services, while R10 million is allocated for debt impairment.Capital BudgetAs mentioned, the municipality&rsquo;s capital budget totals R163&nbsp;758&nbsp;000. The biggest chunk of this amount will go towards labour-intensive projects, mainly roads and transport (R88&nbsp;890&nbsp;000). These projects were highlighted in last week&rsquo;s edition of the Zoutpansberger. A further R9&nbsp;802&nbsp;000 will be spent&nbsp;on planning and development, bringing the total to R98&nbsp;691&nbsp;000 for economic and environmental services. The second-biggest piece of the pie will go towards upgrading trading services, mainly the municipality&rsquo;s electrical infrastructure. For this, an amount of R58&nbsp;336&nbsp;000 was allocated. This includes the amount the municipality plans to spend on upgrading Louis Trichardt&rsquo;s main electrical substation from 44MVA to 66MVA. Smaller amounts were also allocated to finance and administration (R4&nbsp;350&nbsp;000) and community and social services (R2&nbsp;380&nbsp;000). Of the R163&nbsp;758&nbsp;000 needed to fund all their capital projects, the municipality aims to generate R49&nbsp;368&nbsp;000 in own revenue. The rest (R114&nbsp;390&nbsp;000) will be funded from grants from the national government.Summary of GrantsBy far the biggest source of revenue for the municipality will again be grant allocations, totalling R416&nbsp;305&nbsp;000 for the 2017/18 financial year. Without these allocation, the municipality would not have been able to function.The equitable share grant tops the log with an amount of R294&nbsp;079&nbsp;000. Second in line is the municipal infrastructure grant (MIG) to the amount of R91&nbsp;196&nbsp;000, while the Integrated National Electrification Programme Grant will put a further R25 million in the municipality&rsquo;s pocket. Smaller grants include the Demarcation Transition Grant (R2&nbsp;282&nbsp;000) and the Local Government Financial Management Grant (R1,7 million).&nbsp;&nbsp;Andries joined the Zoutpansberger&nbsp;and Limpopo Mirror in April 1993 as a darkroom assistant.
