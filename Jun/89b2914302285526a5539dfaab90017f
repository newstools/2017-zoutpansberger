We were without a permanent municipal manager for almost two years and it was a worrying factor, as we recently received disapproval of the rollover of R110 million from the treasury this year,&rdquo; said the executive mayor, Cllr Florence Radzilani.According to Radzilani, the municipality received&nbsp;information that the funds given to them were returned to the treasury on the basis that the municipality did&nbsp;not have a permanent manager and no one to account for the funds. &ldquo;We have full confidence with the appointment of Mr Rambado as new MM for our district, because he is not&nbsp;new to this&nbsp;sphere of government,&quot; added Radzilani.Mr Rambado said that he hoped&nbsp;to work with the dedicated employees to steer the municipality to greater heights. &ldquo;As a district, we are developing an action plan&nbsp;that will see councillors and employees working hand in hand in delivering better service&nbsp;to the communities. We are encouraging our employees to be hands-on and communicate well the progammes and projects of the district municipality,&rdquo; Rambado added.Prior his appointment, Rambado was chief director in the Department of Communications.Email: More photos...
