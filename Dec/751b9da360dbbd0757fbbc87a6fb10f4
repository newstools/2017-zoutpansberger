“My art speaks differently to me than everyone else, and that is what I like about art. It does not have a direct message linked to it.” These are the words of one of Louis Trichardt’s young artists, the 18-year-old Hayley Waller. Hayley finished her matric exams at Ridgeway College a few weeks ago. During the college’s prize-giving ceremony, she received numerous awards. One of her subjects was art and, even though the final results are not yet available, she received a lot of compliments for her work. After the exams one of the moderators phoned the school, remarking that it was the best work he has seen in ten years. For Hayley, art has been part of her life since a very young age. She won her first art award when she was only in grade 1, competing against a variety of much older artists in Louis Trichardt. “I don’t see art as a competitive activity and I would still have been the same even if I did not win, but it was then that I found out I had a talent,” said Hayley. Hayley practices her art as a hobby and does not believe she should get paid. She also does not intend pursuing this as a career. “Being paid for my art takes away the sentimental value,” said Hayley. Hayley first started drawing animals, but eventually started to prefer finger drawings and portraits. She mainly draws human bodies and body parts such as hands and faces. “The human body in itself is beautiful and provides me with ideas and thoughts,” said Hayley. Her inspiration comes from past experiences and the difficulties she had to face in her life. Her art also serves as her “coping method” to handle life’s challenges.
