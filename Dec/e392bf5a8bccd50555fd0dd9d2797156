Is Flakka, also known as the Zombie Drug, available in the Vhembe District? This drug, which is relatively new on the South African scene, has been spotted in places throughout the country and is cause for great concern. Flakka (alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone) is a drug that causes people to feel panic and hysteria. It also goes by the name Zombie Drug or Red Devil. The past couple of months, numerous videos have been uploaded on the Internet showing the nasty and violent side-effects of the drug after consumption. More recently, footage of Flakka addicts in Durban has gone viral among South Africans. People under the influence of Flakka pose a real danger to themselves and those around them. Flakka can be taken in tablet form or snorted and sells for between R400 and R1 000 a shot. It is a combination of heroin and crack cocaine or heroin and tik. It can also be smoked or injected and is, supposedly, an estimated ten times more effective than cocaine. Apart from Durban, Flakka incidents have also been reported in Cape Town and is slowly making its way to big cities within South Africa such is Johannesburg and Pretoria. The Zoutpansberger tried to establish whether the drug made its way north to Limpopo towns. A source from within the local police, who wished to remain anonymous, said that he is not aware of any cases where Flakka was found in the Vhembe region. He did, however, say that a similar drug, with the street name Crocodile or Krokodil, has already hit the streets of Thohoyandou. The Crocodile drug gets its name because of its after effects due to long-term addiction. After a period, the user’s skin starts turning greenish in colour, as well as becoming scaly and bumpy like the hide of a crocodile. This can result in amputations as flesh starts rotting of completely, leaving only bare bones.
