Limpopo opted to bat first and, thanks to Chris-Jan Hendriks (57 off 29 balls) and Juan Phillips (12 from 14 balls), got off to a good start. Vimal Shah (16 off 18) and Joubert Fourie (11 off 12) helped to take the score to 139/7 in 18 overs.Premjee lost a number of early wickets, which didn&rsquo;t assist their chances of chasing the score, but Louis van Jaarsveld (11), Riaan Gerber (31) and Vic Grobler (17) then put in a good effort to take the score to 101. For Limpopo, four bowlers, namely AJ Fourie (2/23), Vimal Shah (2/11), Brendon Bridge (2/24) and Joubert Fourie (2/14), each took two wickets.On Sunday, the Premjee team came up against Strikers and this time they batted first. AJ Fourie (this time in Premjee colours) opened the batting and scored a good 34 runs before being caught.
