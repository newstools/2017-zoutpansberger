When police arrived at the scene, an administration building of the school was on fire.&nbsp;School books and cement stored in the building was damaged in the blaze.The fire was put out and the rest of the school building was saved.Eyewitness News reported that the spokesperson for the Department of Basic Education, Mr Elijah Mhlanga, confirmed that the computer laboratory of the primary school was also affected in the arson attack. &nbsp;In the meantime the police are continuing to investigate the matter so as to arrest the culprits behind the attack.Last year about 30 schools were burnt or vandalised during protest over the same issue. The Vuwani community&rsquo;s tensions have resurfaced over the weekend following a recent decision by the demarcation board to reject the community&rsquo;s appeal to revert the area back to its previous municipality.&ldquo;Community members must understand that when they torch schools they&rsquo;re torching the future of our children. We&rsquo;re going to leave no stones unturned until all those who were involved are behind bars,&rdquo; said Ngoepe.Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter.
