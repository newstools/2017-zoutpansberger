The student at Thasululo FET at Tshisahulu, was sleeping in an outside room and at about 04:30 on Friday morning she was allegedly surprised by an unknown attacker, who stabbed her in the chest.Circumstances leading to the attack are still sketchy. At the door of the house and outside, pools of blood were discovered on Friday morning (20th) and it seems as if the girl tried to run before she collapsed. She died a few metres from the house.Word of the murder spread like wildfire as within a short space of time the scene was swarming with onlookers who had come from neighbouring Shayandima and Manamani.The name of the deceased will be made available as soon as the police have notified her next-of-kin.
