He added that the team is determined to seek permission for a scheduled mass community gathering at the Nandoni Sports Ground to &ldquo;pave the way forward&rdquo; before then.Last week&rsquo;s shutdown of services lasted for six days, during which time a school was set alight.The Vuwani community is still upset with a recent decision by the Municipal Demarcation Board that rejected all submissions made by the traditional leaders to reconsider the municipal boundaries in the area.Email: More photos...
