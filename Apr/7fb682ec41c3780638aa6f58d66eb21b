Their defence was that they had intended to contact the police to hand over information about Ruben, and in turn could be registered as police informants.It is expected that the investigating officer in the case will testified for the state, after Muchagowa has finished his bail application.Keep on reading the Zoutpansberger for updates on the court proceedings.&nbsp;Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter.
