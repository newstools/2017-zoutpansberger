Date: 06 April 2017 By: Isabel VenterViewed: 252Musina based attorney Mr Hennie Erwee on Wednesday confirmed that the Constitutional Court rejected an appeal by the Department of Environmental Affairs (DoE) to keep a ban on domestic trade in rhino horn.The appeal was the DoE&rsquo;s last option to retain a moratorium on domestic trade in rhino horns. In addition, the Constitutional Court ruled that the DoE must pay the legal cost of the appeal. The ruling by the Constitutional Court effectively means that rhino horns may now be traded with within South Africa.DoE spokesperson Albie Modise said they were still considering the implications of the judgment. &ldquo;It is important to note that permits are required to sell or buy rhino horn,&rdquo; he said in a press statement.The ruling will have little impact outside South Africa because a ban on international trade is still in force. A detailed report will appear in next week&rsquo;s edition of the Zoutpansberger.&nbsp;Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter.
