VDMDate: 24 April 2017 By: Prudence BopapeViewed: 71The Vhembe District Municipality (VDM) lashed out at residents making illegal water connections and in the process damage infrastructure and said that this denies other villages essential services such as water.Mr Matodzi Ralushai, the spokesperson for the VDM, said illegal water connections are taking place in and around the Nzhelele region. The result is that water coming from the Mutshedzi dam is unable to reach villages such as Biaba, Tshituni and Mawoni.&ldquo;We are all deeply affected by this, because when people start taking matters into their own hands, and by stealing from themselves, they ruin the water infrastructure,&rdquo; said Ralushai. He said that this is to the detriment of other communities that also need the water.The Mayor of Makhado Municipality, Cllr Shonisani Sinyosi,&nbsp;was highly disappointed to have witnessed this destruction taking place, as water spilled all over the ground due to pipes that were inserted illegally and directed to people&rsquo;s households. The mayor recently visited the area to gain first-hand experience of the problems residents have to endure.Ralushai said that people making use of these illegal connections hamper progress in other communities. &ldquo;At some point people need to govern themselves and act responsibly, because the police and other law enforcement bodies cannot govern and tell people what is right and what is wrong,&rdquo; he said.Ralushai said that the municipality is trying by all means to deliver services to people, but if people do not co-operate, they slow down the process. &ldquo;With co-operation from the community, we will be able to catch the culprits and open a case. If we work together progress is guaranteed, but if people work against us we will continuously be fixing the mistakes and never make any progress,&rdquo; he added.The 22-year-old Prudence Bopape from Ha-Masia village joined the Zoutnet newsroom as an intern on the 1st of February 2017.&nbsp;Prudence completed her Bachelor of Arts degree, specialising in communications, at the Northwest University.
