Date: 03 April 2017 By: Elmon TshikhudoViewed: 2102Vuwani&rsquo;s demarcation issues, which have been on the back-burner for months, have once again reared its ugly head, causing the emotions of the local community and traditional leaders to run at an all-time high.Last week the Municipal Demarcation Board rejected all submissions made by the traditional leaders, whereupon the traditional leaders pulled out of any further talks with government. The board&rsquo;s decision was not received well by the Vuwani community, who had hoped for an amicable solution.On Sunday morning (2 April) residents, who were to meet at the local Nandoni Sports ground, were stopped from doing so by police who told them that their meeting was illegal. Community leaders were slapped with a letter from the Lim345 Municipality prohibiting them to meet.Following this an indefinite shutdown was declared by the community.During the course of the evening sporadic incidents of violence were reported. Community members allegedly also attempted to blockade the main road between Elim and Malamulele.On Monday (today) all businesses and offices in Vuwani remained closed.Residents have indicated that they are still determined to meet and that their legal team has written to LIM345 and the SAPS to withdraw their letter and grant them permission to proceed with the gathering.&ldquo;Should they fail to respond by 12:00 this afternoon we will be heading to High Court for [an] declaratory order,&rdquo; said Nsovo Sambo one of the community leaders.In the meantime, the Limpopo police spokesperson, Lt Col Moatshe Ngoepe, said that the situation was quiet and that police are on high alert and monitoring the situation. He further confirmed that two people were arrested on charges of public violence and that they are expected to appear before the Malamulele Magistrate&rsquo;s Court soon.
