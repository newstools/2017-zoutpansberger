It is one of only a few cross-border races in the world, and one of the races with the biggest prize money in the Limpopo province.The race was the initiative of a former teacher, Mr Conrad Stolz of Eric Louw High School, who hosted the first race 20 years ago, and has taken place ever since with the support of local businesses and the Musina Municipality.The race has always been dominated by Zimbabwean athletes and, despite some strong opposition from and efforts by well-known athletes from South Africa that have participated in recent years, Nkosiyazi Sibanda has won the 42km race for the past seven&nbsp;years in a row! The race is sponsored by the Musina Municipality. Athletes can also take part in a 5km, 10km and 21km race on the day.
